# README Generator

## Description
When creating a project on GitHub, it's important to have a high-quality README. It should include what the application is for, how it's used, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. Creating a README can feel tedious at times though. That's where the README Generator comes in! By answering questions in the command line, a README will quickly be generated.

## Installation
To install this application, you can clone the repository. You will need `node.js` installed, along with `Inquirer.js`, in order to use the application.
## Usage
In the root directory, you will run node index.js in the command line. A set of questions will then be asked. Once you answer all the questions, a README.md will be generated in the dis folder. You can move it to your desired location from there. Remember, the more thorough you are with answering the command line questions, the better the README will be.
